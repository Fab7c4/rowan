"""Find optimal mappings between two sets of points.

`hamilton.map` provides methods for solving a number of closely related
problems involving finding optimal mappings between two sets of points.

Broadly speaking, the class of problems to solve is the following: given
two matrices matrix to find the 

The first instance of this classical problem is the `orthogonal Procrustes
problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_Procrustes_problem>`,
while more recent related formulations include `Wahba's Problem
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahba%27s_problem>`. More general
formulations fall under the broad umbrella of generalized or constrained
Procrustes problems.

A number of different solutions have been developed to solve this problem
in different fields. Peter Sch√∂nemann's original solution to the orthogonal
Procrustes problem solves for
